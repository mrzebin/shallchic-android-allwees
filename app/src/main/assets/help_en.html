        <h5>Why did I receive an email confirming an order I didn't place?</h5>
        <p>If you received an email confirming an order that you didnâ€™t place, itâ€™s possible that there has been unauthorized activity on your account.

        <h5>Why am I blocked from getting refunds?</h5>
        <p>We strive to provide our customers with the best possible service, and must periodically ensure that all consumers on the platform are not unfairly benefiting from our generous refund & return policies. Shoppers who abuse these policies negatively impact the entire platform, including the experience of other shoppers.</p>
        <p>To determine that an account has had excessive refunds, our system analyzes account activity, as well as activity across multiple accounts that may be connected. If we find that an account continues to have excessive returns and refunds, it may violate our <a href="returnPolicy.html">Return Policy</a> and may be blocked from future refunds.</p>
        <p>With regard to your refund and support interactions, we will continue to fully support your purchases once your account is back in good standing. You can get your account back in good standing by continuing to purchase on AllWees.</p>

        <li class="circle">From a non-mobile device, visit your cart.</li>

        </ul>
        <h5>Why are there different prices for the same item?</h5>
        <p>There are 2 main reasons why you may see different prices for the same product:</p>
        <ul>
        <li class="circle">The size, color or variation you selected is priced differently. In some cases, the price of the item may vary depending on your choice of size, color, or variation.</li>
        <li class="circle">The same item is being sold by multiple stores. Stores set their own prices for each item, so it's possible for different stores to sell the same product at different prices.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Why did the price of shipping change when I added the item to my cart?</h5>
        <p>When you add an item to your cart the price and shipping shouldnâ€™t change, but there are some rare exceptions:</p>
        <p>a.Updated shipping address information</p>
        <ul>
        <li class="circle">Shipping prices will vary depending on where you ship an item, so sometimes weâ€™ll need to update the shipping price once we have updated shipping information.</li>
        <li class="circle">Some governments also have taxes. We do our best to include taxes up front, but this might change prices and shipping once the shipping address is updated.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>b.Changing market conditions over time</p>
        <ul>
        <li class="circle">Prices and shipping can change due to market conditions changing throughout the day.  If youâ€™ve been looking at an item for a while or itâ€™s been sitting in your cart for an extended period of time, the price and shipping may increase or decrease.</li>
        <li class="circle">Merchants may update their costs, which will change the price and shipping for an item based on supply and demand.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Shipping</h3>
        <h5>How long will shipping take</h5>
        <p>Shipping times vary based on the individual store and destination.</p>
        <p>To view estimated shipping times for your orders, please visit your Order History</p>
        <h5>How much does shipping cost?</h5>
        <p>shipping costs are applied separately per item and not per order. The cost varies depending on the size, weight, and destination of your order. You can view the shipping cost per item in your cart at checkout.</p>
        <p>Stores choose the best way to send their items and may ship your items in separate packages or all together in one.</p>
        <h5>Which shipping methods are available?</h5>
        <p>AllWees is a global platform that connects customers with stores from around the world. To maintain low shipping costs, stores will generally choose an economical shipping option based on your location and the size of the order.</p>
        <p>Your order may ship from a variety of locations depending on your shipping address and the store's location. Once the parcel reaches your country, it will be handed over to your local carrier for the final leg of delivery.</p>
        <h5>Where do my orders ship from?</h5>
        <p>AllWees is a global platform that connects customers with stores across the world. Your order could ship from a variety of locations depending on the store's location.</p>
        <h5>Are there any items that can't be shipped to my country because they are restricted?</h5>
        <p>Updated Stores are obligated to follow applicable law, including the laws established by the customs and border control agencies of the countries to which they are shipping. The platform has tools that stores can use to help to limit and/or restrict exposure of illicit items to customers based on the laws of their country.</p>
        <p>However, if you are still unsure about an item, we encourage you to review your countryâ€™s laws and regulations regarding imported products before making a purchase.</p>
        <h5>My package is late. What should I do?</h5>
        <p>Sometimes weather, high packet volume, or other unforeseen circumstances can cause postal service delays. If your item doesn't arrive by the latest estimated delivery date, please contact support in the AllWees app so that our AllWees Assistant can help you.</p>
        <h3>Payments and Promotions</h3>
        <h5>Why was I charged twice for my order?</h5>
        <p>In some cases, our payment processor may have trouble capturing your payment on its first attempt. Our system will then re-try the capture. This means that you may see a duplicate charge on your statement that is authorized but not captured.</p>
        <p>Depending on your bankâ€™s policies, you may see this duplicate/pending charge credited or completely removed from your statement within the next 14 days, but it could take longer. Please contact your bank to verify how long it may take for the charge to be removed.</p>
        <h5>When will I be charged for my order?</h5>
        <p>Depending on which payment method you use, it may take a week or two for our system to process your payment and ship your order.</p>
        <p>However, you may see an authorization on your account once your order is placed. If you decide to cancel your order within 8 hours, your bank will either credit or remove the authorization from your statement.</p>
        <h5>Why is my payment being declined?</h5>
        <p>Your payment may be declined for one of the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li class="circle">Your card is expired.</li>
        <li class="circle">You have insufficient funds.</li>
        <li class="circle">Your card was reported as stolen or frozen.</li>
        <li class="circle">If you are using a debit card, it may not have a CVV and/or cannot be billed as a credit card.
We recommend contacting your bank or financial institution to resolve your payment issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>How do I get a promotion?</h5>
        <p>Here are a few ways that you can find a promo code:</p>
        <ul>

        <li class="circle">Complete assigned tasks</li>
        <li class="circle">Check your push notifications for new promo codes</li>

        </ul>
        <p>Please remember that coupons will have an expiration date, so make sure to use your coupon before it expires!</p>
        <h3>Refunds</h3>
        <h5>When will I get the refund from my cancelled order?</h5>
        <p>If you received the refund to your original payment method, please allow several 10-14 business days for the refund to appear in your account. In some cases, especially with credit cards, your original charge may drop from your statement and you won't see a refund in your account.</p>
        <h5>What's the status of my refund?</h5>
        <p>You can check the status of your refund by visiting your Order History.</p>
